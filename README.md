# Playdate Sandbox

A sandbox project to test my Odin bindings for the Playdate SDK. The bindings can be found at [BazzaGibbs/playdate](https://github.com/Bazzagibbs/playdate).

## Cloning this repository

This repository contains a submodule for my Playdate package (located in `src/playdate`), so it must be cloned recursively:
